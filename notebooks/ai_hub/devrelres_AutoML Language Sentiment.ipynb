    "### Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates using the AutoML API for Language Sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "The audience for this notebook are software engineers (SWE) with limited experience in machine learning (ML).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequistes\n",
    "\n",
    "One should be familar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Python 3.X\n",
    "    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and using GCP buckets.\n",
    "    - Concept of Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook using the Kaggle dataset for PetFinder Adoption Prediction, located at:\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data\n",
    "    \n",
    "From the Kaggle web page, you will need to select the Download for train_sentiment_zip. Once downloaded to your laptop, you will need to unzip the folder. Once unzipped, there will be a subfolder named train_sentiment, which will contain several JSON files, each of which is a subset of instances (examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance will contain:\n",

    "        \n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial is to learn how to use the AutoML API to train a model for sentiment analysis, deploy the model and do predictions using a gRPC or REST API interface.\n",
